change name of handleMove (because theres 3 move function)
put a error boundary (so error doesn't stop the whole app)
make toupperCase toLowerCase or toWhitePiece toBlackPiece available globally (more standardize) 
make test so I don't have to worry about this anymore
separate boardView logic to customHook (to run test)
